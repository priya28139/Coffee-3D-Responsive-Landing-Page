# Coffee-3D-Responsive-Landing-Page

Always been a coffee fan, but didn't know this is how my love for coffee would pour out :p Built a completely responsive landing page for Coffee 3D: the make-believe coffee shop thats always been around the corner of your street - one which sells incredibly amazing coffee with equally delectable croissants! 

Put together using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Oh and special thanks to Boxicons (https://boxicons.com/) for the cutesy icons and GreenSock (https://greensock.com/gsap/) for the breathtaking animations ~
